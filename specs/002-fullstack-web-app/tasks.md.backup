# Tasks: Phase II - Todo Full-Stack Web Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-fullstack-web-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included as the constitution requires ≥80% backend coverage, ≥70% frontend coverage.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/src/`, `backend/tests/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/tests/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Registration) → Can start after Phase 2
  - US2 (Authentication) → Can start after Phase 2, integrates with US1
  - US3 (View Tasks) → Can start after Phase 2, requires auth from US2
  - US4 (Add Task) → Can start after Phase 2, requires US3 for display
  - US5 (Toggle Complete) → Can start after Phase 2, requires US3 for display
  - US6 (Update Task) → Can start after Phase 2, requires US3 for display
  - US7 (Delete Task) → Can start after Phase 2, requires US3 for display
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

Phase 10: Polish
```

### Within Each User Story

1. Tests written first (they will fail)
2. Backend implementation (models → endpoints)
3. Frontend implementation (components → pages)
4. Integration and error handling
5. Story checkpoint validation

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 - Setup** (all [P] tasks):
```
T002 (backend init) | T003 (frontend init) | T004-T006 (CLAUDE.md files)
T007-T010 (config files)
```

**Phase 2 - Foundational** (backend and frontend can parallelize):
```
Backend: T011-T022 (sequential except [P] marked)
Frontend: T023-T032 (can run in parallel with backend)
```

**User Story Tests** (per story):
```
Each story's test tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
```

**Cross-Story Parallelization** (after US3 complete):
```
US4, US5, US6, US7 can all proceed in parallel once US3 is done
(they all depend on the task list UI from US3)
```

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 2 Foundation

```bash
# Backend foundation (sequential core, parallel utilities)
T011 → T012 → T013 → T014 (parallel) | T015 → T016 → T017
T018, T019, T020, T021, T022 (all parallel - just init files)

# Frontend foundation (mostly parallel)
T023 | T024 | T025 | T026 | T027 | T028 (all parallel)
T029 → T030 → T031 → T032 (sequential - layout dependencies)
```

---

### Incremental Delivery

1. MVP (US1-3) → Users can register, login, see tasks
2. MVP + US4 (Add Task) → Users can create tasks
3. MVP + US5 (Toggle) → Users can complete tasks
4. MVP + US6 (Update) → Users can edit tasks
5. MVP + US7 (Delete) → Users can remove tasks
6. MVP + US8 (Priority) → Users can set priorities
7. MVP + US9 (Tags) → Users can tag tasks
8. MVP + US10 (Search) → Users can search tasks
9. MVP + US11 (Filter) → Users can filter tasks
10. MVP + US12 (Sort) → Users can sort tasks
11. Polish → Production-ready

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: User Stories 1, 2, 3
- User can register
- User can sign in
- User can view their tasks (seeded or empty state)

This delivers authentication + read capability, proving the full stack works.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All source files MUST include @spec comments per constitution
