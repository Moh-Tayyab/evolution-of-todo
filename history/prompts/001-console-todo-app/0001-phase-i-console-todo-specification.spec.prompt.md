## Prompt

```text
Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo Application

Target audience: Hackathon judges evaluating spec-driven development mastery, future self/maintainers reviewing the foundational phase

Focus: Build a fully functional, clean, and well-structured command-line Todo application that stores tasks in memory, demonstrating strict adherence to Spec-Driven Development using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

Success criteria:
- Implements all 5 Basic Level features exactly as required:
  - Add Task: Create new todo items with title (required) and description (optional)
  - View Task List: Display all tasks with unique ID, title, description, and completion status indicator (e.g., [ ] or [x])
  - Update Task: Modify title and/or description of an existing task by ID
  - Delete Task: Remove a task by ID
  - Mark as Complete: Toggle completion status of a task by ID
- Application runs as a interactive console loop with clear menu/commands and user-friendly prompts
- All code is generated exclusively by Claude Code based on refined specs — no manual coding
- Demonstrates multiple iterations of spec refinement until Claude Code produces correct, clean implementation
- Follows Python best practices: type hints, docstrings, modular structure, error handling, and separation of concerns
- Project structure is professional and reproducible

Constraints:
- Data storage: In-memory only (list/dict of task objects); no file or database persistence
- Language: Python 3.13+
- Project setup: Managed with UV (uv venv, uv pip for dependencies if any)
- Dependencies: Minimal — standard library only preferred; only add external packages if absolutely necessary and justified in spec
- No GUI or web interface — pure console/CLI only
- Single-file or small multi-file structure acceptable, but must be organized under /src
- Commands must be intuitive (e.g., menu-driven or simple text commands like "add", "list", "complete 3")

Not building:
- Persistent storage (files, database)
- Multi-user support or authentication
- Intermediate features (priorities, tags, due dates, search, sorting)
- Advanced features (recurring tasks, reminders)
- Web/API interface
- Any deployment beyond local execution
- Unit tests (optional for Phase I, but encouraged if spec includes them)

Deliverables that must be present in GitHub repository:
- speckit.constitution (already created)
- /specs/ folder containing this and all subsequent specification files with history
- /src/ folder with all Python source code (generated by Claude Code)
- README.md with clear setup and running instructions (e.g., uv venv, uv pip install -r requirements.txt if any, python -m src.main)
- CLAUDE.md at root with detailed instructions for Claude Code on how to use specs, project structure, and coding standards
- Evidence of spec-driven process (multiple spec versions showing refinement if needed)
```

## Response snapshot

Successfully created comprehensive Phase I specification for In-Memory Python Console Todo Application on branch `001-console-todo-app`.

**Specification Highlights**:

**3 Prioritized User Stories**:
1. **P1 - Manage Task Lifecycle**: Core CRUD operations (add, view, update, delete, mark complete) with 6 detailed acceptance scenarios covering all 5 Basic Level requirements
2. **P2 - Handle Invalid Input Gracefully**: Error handling with 5 acceptance scenarios for edge cases (non-existent IDs, empty titles, invalid menu options)
3. **P3 - Navigate Application Intuitively**: UX improvements with 4 acceptance scenarios for menu clarity, exit flow, and user feedback

**12 Functional Requirements**: Complete coverage of console menu, task operations (CRUD+complete), ID assignment, in-memory storage, display formatting, error messages, and input validation

**Key Entity Defined**: Task (ID, Title, Description, Status) with clear attribute specifications

**7 Measurable Success Criteria**: Technology-agnostic metrics including timing (10s task creation, 60s full demo), capacity (100 tasks), reliability (100% error handling), and spec-driven fidelity (zero manual edits)

**8 Edge Cases Documented**: Empty titles, non-existent IDs, empty list, long text, ID collisions, toggle behavior, restart data loss, invalid input types

**6 Assumptions Documented**: Console width, input method, session duration, error recovery, task capacity, command format

**Quality Validation**: All checklist items passed (no implementation details, testable requirements, measurable success criteria, complete acceptance scenarios, clear scope)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created foundational Phase I specification enabling Claude Code to generate console todo application with complete CRUD functionality and error handling
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (specification phase; 11 acceptance scenarios defined for future implementation validation)
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md, checklists/requirements.md, PHR 0001
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to design implementation architecture, or `/sp.clarify` if additional requirements discovered (none needed currently)
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances completeness (12 FRs, 11 acceptance scenarios) with clarity (no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers). Assumptions section provides reasonable defaults for all design decisions. Ready for planning phase without user clarifications.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; specification complete on first iteration with zero clarification requests
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist validation: PASSED (12/12 items)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow with comprehensive user input
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.plan to validate that specification provides sufficient detail for architectural planning without gaps
