## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

**tasks.md ALREADY EXISTS** - Verified comprehensive task coverage for Phase III:

| Phase | Task Count | Focus |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Phase 1: Setup | 9 | Dependencies (Framer Motion, GSAP, Aceternity UI) |
| Phase 2: Animation Foundation | 6 | Animation library (variants, hooks, GSAP) |
| Phase 3: Core Components | 26 | Button, Input, Card, Dialog |
| Phase 4: Page Animations | 18 | Transitions, dashboard, GSAP scroll effects |
| Phase 5: Premium Components | 16 | Aceternity UI (Bento Grid, 3D Cards, Spotlight) |
| Phase 6: Micro-interactions | 12 | Button effects, icons, loading, empty states |
| Phase 7: Accessibility | 6 | Reduced motion, keyboard, responsive |
| Phase 8: Performance | 8 | Optimization & testing |
| **Total** | **101** | |

**Task Format Validation:** ✅ ALL TASKS follow the strict checklist format
- Checkbox: `- [ ]`
- Task ID: T001-T096 + T043a-T043h
- File paths: Exact paths in frontend/src/
- [P] markers: Parallelizable tasks identified

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: tasks.md already exists with 101 tasks across 8 phases
- 🧪 Tests: Not required (UI/UX enhancement - visual validation)
- 📁 Files: specs/003-modern-ui-ux/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to begin implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: tasks.md was previously generated and includes all GSAP scroll animation tasks (T043a-T043h). Ready for immediate execution.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
