## Prompt

```text
Project: The Evolution of Todo – Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI
This constitution defines the non-negotiable principles, standards, constraints, and success criteria for the "Evolution of Todo" hackathon project. It serves as the foundational governance for all development activities, ensuring alignment with spec-driven, AI-native methodologies. All agents, tools, and human contributors must adhere to this document. No code or architecture changes are permitted without explicit reference to and compliance with these rules.

Core Principles

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) as Core Workflow: Every feature, phase, and implementation must follow the SDD lifecycle: Specify (WHAT) → Plan (HOW) → Tasks (BREAKDOWN) → Implement (CODE). No manual coding is allowed; all code must be generated by Claude Code based on refined specs.
AI-Native Architecture: Shift from syntax writing to system architecture. Use AI agents (e.g., Claude Code, OpenAI Agents SDK) for execution, with humans acting as product architects.
Progressive Evolution: Build incrementally across 5 phases, from in-memory console app to distributed cloud-native AI system, ensuring each phase builds on the previous without regressions.
Cloud-Native and Event-Driven Focus: Emphasize scalability, resilience, and decoupling through tools like Kubernetes, Dapr, and Kafka, prioritizing stateless designs and loose coupling.
Reusability and Intelligence: Promote reusable AI components (e.g., Claude Code Subagents, Agent Skills) and cloud-native blueprints to enhance efficiency and modularity.
Security and User Isolation: Enforce authentication, JWT-based authorization, and data isolation per user across all phases involving multi-user features.

Key Standards

Development Process:
Use Spec-Kit Plus for managing specs in an organized structure (/specs/overview.md, /specs/features/*.md, etc.).
Reference specs explicitly in implementations (e.g., @specs/features/task-crud.md).
Maintain CLAUDE.md files at root, frontend, and backend levels for agent guidance.
All specs must include user stories, acceptance criteria, and links to related artifacts (e.g., API endpoints, database schemas).

Tech Stack Compliance:
Phase I: Python 3.13+, UV, Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus.
Phase II: Next.js 16+ (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS), FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, Better Auth (JWT for authentication).
Phase III: OpenAI ChatKit (frontend), OpenAI Agents SDK, Official MCP SDK (for tools), stateless MCP server with database-persisted state.
Phase IV: Docker (with Gordon AI if available), Minikube, Helm Charts, kubectl-ai, Kagent for local K8s deployment.
Phase V: Dapr (Pub/Sub, State, Bindings, Secrets, Service Invocation), Kafka (Redpanda Cloud or Strimzi self-hosted), DigitalOcean DOKS (or alternatives like AKS/GKE/Oracle OKE), GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
Bonus: Reusable intelligence via Claude Code Subagents/Agent Skills, cloud-native blueprints, multi-language support (Urdu), voice commands.

Code and Architecture Standards:
Clean code principles: Modular, readable, with proper error handling and documentation.
Database: Use SQLModel for ORM; enforce user_id foreign keys for isolation.
API: RESTful endpoints with JWT auth; MCP tools for AI interactions (e.g., add_task, list_tasks).
Event-Driven: Publish events to Kafka topics (e.g., task-events, reminders) for decoupling services like notifications and recurring tasks.
Testing: 100% coverage for core features; include unit tests in specs.
Documentation: README.md with setup, CLAUDE.md for agent instructions, specs history folder.

Monorepo Structure:
Root: .spec-kit/config.yaml, specs/ (organized by type), CLAUDE.md, frontend/, backend/, docker-compose.yml.
No separate repos; all in one for easier Claude Code context.

Bonus Implementation Standards:
If pursuing bonuses, specs must explicitly define reusable components, blueprints, language/voice integrations without violating core stack.

Constraints

No Manual Coding: All implementations must be generated by Claude Code via refined specs. Review prompts and iterations for compliance.
Phase Dependencies: Complete phases sequentially; no skipping. Each phase must demonstrate all required features from Basic/Intermediate/Advanced levels as applicable.
Stateless Design: Servers (e.g., chat endpoint, MCP tools) must be stateless, persisting state to database (Neon PostgreSQL).
Deployment: Local on Minikube for Phase IV; cloud on DigitalOcean DOKS (or equivalents) for Phase V. Use free tiers/credits where possible.
Resource Limits: Adhere to free tiers (e.g., Neon free DB, Redpanda Serverless, DigitalOcean $200 credit). No paid services beyond credits.
Feature Scope: Implement exactly the specified features per level (Basic: CRUD + Complete; Intermediate: Priorities/Tags/Search/Filter/Sort; Advanced: Recurring/Due Dates/Reminders).
Bonus Constraints: Bonuses optional but must integrate seamlessly; e.g., Urdu support in chatbot without breaking English flows.
Submission Limits: GitHub repo public; demo video ≤90 seconds; include WhatsApp for judging.

Success Criteria

Full Phase Completion: All 5 phases implemented with working deliverables (e.g., console app, web app, chatbot, local/cloud deployments).
Spec-Driven Fidelity: 100% of code traceable to specs; no unimplemented specs or extra features.
Functionality Verification:
Basic: CRUD operations work end-to-end.
Intermediate/Advanced: Features like search, recurring tasks, reminders function via natural language in chatbot.
Event-Driven: Kafka events trigger correct actions (e.g., reminders sent, tasks recurred).

Deployment Stability: Local Minikube setup reproducible; cloud deployment accessible with monitoring/logging.
Bonus Achievement: Up to +600 points if implemented and demonstrated.
Overall Quality: Zero security vulnerabilities (e.g., proper auth); passes judge review of prompts/iterations; total points ≥1,000 for core + bonuses for excellence.
Alignment Check: All artifacts (code, specs, docs) comply with this constitution; any deviations require constitution updates before proceeding.
